.NAME
    xDnsServerSetting

.DESCRIPTION
    The xDnsServerSetting DSC resource manages the Domain Name System (DNS) server
    settings and properties.

    If the parameter DnsServer is set to 'localhost' then the resource
    can normally use the default credentials (SYSTEM) to configure the DNS server
    settings. If using any other value for the parameter DnsServer make sure
    that the credential the resource is run as have the correct permissions
    at the target node and the necessary network traffic is permitted (WsMan
    protocol). It is possible to run the resource with specific credentials using the
    built-in parameter PsDscRunAsCredential.

.PARAMETER DnsServer
    Key - String
    Specifies the DNS server to connect to, or use 'localhost' for the current node.

.PARAMETER AddressAnswerLimit
    Write - UInt32
    Maximum number of host records returned in response to an address request. Values between 5 and 28 are valid.

.PARAMETER AllowUpdate
    Write - UInt32
    Specifies whether the DNS Server accepts dynamic update requests.

.PARAMETER AutoCacheUpdate
    Write - Boolean
    Indicates whether the DNS Server attempts to update its cache entries using data from root servers.

.PARAMETER AutoConfigFileZones
    Write - UInt32
    Indicates which standard primary zones that are authoritative for the name of the DNS Server must be updated when the name server changes.

.PARAMETER BindSecondaries
    Write - Boolean
    Determines the AXFR message format when sending to non-Microsoft DNS Server secondaries.

.PARAMETER BootMethod
    Write - UInt32
    Initialization method for the DNS Server.

.PARAMETER DefaultAgingState
    Write - Boolean
    Default ScavengingInterval value set for all Active Directory-integrated zones created on this DNS Server.

.PARAMETER DefaultNoRefreshInterval
    Write - UInt32
    No-refresh interval, in hours, set for all Active Directory-integrated zones created on this DNS Server.

.PARAMETER DefaultRefreshInterval
    Write - UInt32
    Refresh interval, in hours, set for all Active Directory-integrated zones created on this DNS Server.

.PARAMETER DisableAutoReverseZones
    Write - Boolean
    Indicates whether the DNS Server automatically creates standard reverse look up zones.

.PARAMETER DisjointNets
    Write - Boolean
    Indicates whether the default port binding for a socket used to send queries to remote DNS Servers can be overridden.

.PARAMETER DsPollingInterval
    Write - UInt32
    Interval, in seconds, to poll the DS-integrated zones.

.PARAMETER DsTombstoneInterval
    Write - UInt32
    Lifetime of tombstoned records in Directory Service integrated zones, expressed in seconds.

.PARAMETER EDnsCacheTimeout
    Write - UInt32
    Lifetime, in seconds, of the cached information describing the EDNS version supported by other DNS Servers.

.PARAMETER EnableDirectoryPartitions
    Write - Boolean
    Specifies whether support for application directory partitions is enabled on the DNS Server.

.PARAMETER EnableDnsSec
    Write - UInt32
    Specifies whether the DNS Server includes DNSSEC-specific RRs, KEY, SIG, and NXT in a response.

.PARAMETER EnableEDnsProbes
    Write - Boolean
    Specifies the behavior of the DNS Server. When TRUE, the DNS Server always responds with OPT resource records according to RFC 2671, unless the remote server has indicated it does not support EDNS in a prior exchange. If FALSE, the DNS Server responds to queries with OPTs only if OPTs are sent in the original query.

.PARAMETER ForwardDelegations
    Write - UInt32
    Specifies whether queries to delegated sub-zones are forwarded.

.PARAMETER Forwarders
    Write - StringArray
    Enumerates the list of IP addresses of Forwarders to which the DNS Server forwards queries.

.PARAMETER ForwardingTimeout
    Write - UInt32
    Time, in seconds, a DNS Server forwarding a query will wait for resolution from the forwarder before attempting to resolve the query itself.

.PARAMETER IsSlave
    Write - Boolean
    TRUE if the DNS server does not use recursion when name-resolution through forwarders fails.

.PARAMETER ListenAddresses
    Write - StringArray
    Enumerates the list of IP addresses on which the DNS Server can receive queries.

.PARAMETER LocalNetPriority
    Write - Boolean
    Indicates whether the DNS Server gives priority to the local net address when returning A records.

.PARAMETER LogLevel
    Write - UInt32
    Indicates which policies are activated in the Event Viewer system log.

.PARAMETER LooseWildcarding
    Write - Boolean
    Indicates whether the DNS Server performs loose wildcarding.

.PARAMETER MaxCacheTTL
    Write - UInt32
    Maximum time, in seconds, the record of a recursive name query may remain in the DNS Server cache.

.PARAMETER MaxNegativeCacheTTL
    Write - UInt32
    Maximum time, in seconds, a name error result from a recursive query may remain in the DNS Server cache.

.PARAMETER NameCheckFlag
    Write - UInt32
    Indicates the set of eligible characters to be used in DNS names.

.PARAMETER NoRecursion
    Write - Boolean
    Indicates whether the DNS Server performs recursive look ups. TRUE indicates recursive look ups are not performed.

.PARAMETER RecursionRetry
    Write - UInt32
    Elapsed seconds before retrying a recursive look up.

.PARAMETER RecursionTimeout
    Write - UInt32
    Elapsed seconds before the DNS Server gives up recursive query.

.PARAMETER RoundRobin
    Write - Boolean
    Indicates whether the DNS Server round robins multiple A records.

.PARAMETER RpcProtocol
    Write - SInt16
    RPC protocol or protocols over which administrative RPC runs.

.PARAMETER ScavengingInterval
    Write - UInt32
    Interval, in hours, between two consecutive scavenging operations performed by the DNS Server.

.PARAMETER SecureResponses
    Write - Boolean
    Indicates whether the DNS Server exclusively saves records of names in the same subtree as the server that provided them.

.PARAMETER SendPort
    Write - UInt32
    Port on which the DNS Server sends UDP queries to other servers.

.PARAMETER StrictFileParsing
    Write - Boolean
    Indicates whether the DNS Server parses zone files strictly.

.PARAMETER UpdateOptions
    Write - UInt32
    Restricts the type of records that can be dynamically updated on the server, used in addition to the AllowUpdate settings on Server and Zone objects.

.PARAMETER WriteAuthorityNS
    Write - Boolean
    Specifies whether the DNS Server writes NS and SOA records to the authority section on successful response.

.PARAMETER XfrConnectTimeout
    Write - UInt32
    Time, in seconds, the DNS Server waits for a successful TCP connection to a remote server when attempting a zone transfer.

.PARAMETER DsAvailable
    Read - Boolean
    Indicates whether there is an available DS on the DNS Server.
